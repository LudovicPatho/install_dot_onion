# install_dot_onion

*   **Install Tor:**
    
    *   Install the Tor Browser on your system. You can download it from the official Tor Project website.
*   **Configure the Web Server:**
    
    *   Set up a web server on your machine. Apache is a common choice, but you can use other web servers based on your preferences.
*   **Create the HTML Page:**
    
    *   Create a simple HTML page that you want to host. Save it in the directory of your web server.
*   **Configure the Web Server for Tor:**
    
    *   Modify the configuration of your web server to listen on port 80 and possibly port 443 (for HTTPS traffic).
    *   Ensure that your server is configured to accept connections from localhost.
*   **Configure the Tor Hidden Service File:**
    
    *   Create a configuration file for your .onion service. You can do this by adding the following lines in the torrc file (the Tor configuration file):
        
        bashCopy code
        
        `HiddenServiceDir /path/to/hidden_service_directory HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:80`
        
        Make sure to replace "/path/to/hidden\_service\_directory" with the actual path to your Hidden Service directory.
        
*   **Restart Tor:**
    
    *   Restart the Tor service to apply the configuration changes.
*   **Access Your .onion Site:**
    
    *   Once Tor is restarted, you will find a private key in the Hidden Service directory. Use this private key to access your .onion site via the Tor Browser.
